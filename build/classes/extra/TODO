Storyline:
There's trouble in cube world!
Wicked spheres hav invaded the otherwise peaceful world of the cubes.
It is your job to find the spheres and destroy them before all is lost.
Also take care in your hunt because the underlings of the spheres -
the dreaded CONES - are out to get you.
Now as we all know, cubes prefer to be white so you're only allowed to color
a fixed amount of them at a time.
Luckily the cubes are so desperate in getting rid of the spheres that,
if asked, the cubes will graciously disapper to let you through and then
reappear shortly after.
Good luck. CUBE!
