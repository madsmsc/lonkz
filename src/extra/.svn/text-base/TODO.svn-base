  A Java Profiler can be added to the jMonkeyPlatform via
    Tools → Plugins → Available.
    The profiler presents statistics on the lifecycle of methods and objects.
    Performance problems may be caused by just a few methods that take long,
    or are called too often. If object creation and garbage collection counts
    keep increasing, you are looking at a memory leak.
  Save games -> perhaps in lib folder?
